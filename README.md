## Insights 

-  Advise the management of KMS on what to do to increase the revenue from the bottom 10 Customers
-  we are identifying low perfoming customers in terms of sales
-  A few reasons why these 10 customers are under performing may be due to:
   1. They are new customers with low purchase history
   2. the products are not widely available to customers in that locality or area,
   3. they are buy once customers or inactive customers that probably just wanted to try the product
   4. Dissatisfied customers that did not border to comeback due to their first experience
 
-  Recommendation to increase revenue using the bottom performimg customers
   1. Loyalty incentives
   2. Customer feedback collection
   3. Account based follow up
   4. Engagement focused campaigns
   5. Customer profiling and segmentation
   6. Availability of products in these areas to drive more sales
